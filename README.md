# Crane app server

This is the server for the [crane app](https://github.com/benjaminJohnson2204/craneapp) that I'm working on. The server is hosted on Heroku at https://craneapp-server.herokuapp.com/.

The stack for the server is MongoDB, Express, and Node. I've written most of the backend code, but I'm still working on the client code.
